      <h3>About Me!</h3>
      <p>Web development to me is fun, exciting, and also very challenging which makes it so great. I enjoy finding the solutions to problems and building code.</p>
      <p>I am anxious to start to code with a team of ambitous fellow developers and further my knowledge of this challenging career. I consider myself a team player and enjoy working with others on projects. I am hopeful to see where that takes me.</p>
      <p>When I am not working on web development I am:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>With my family</li>
          <li>Playing and teaching soccer to my sons</li>
          <li>Training my dogs</li>
